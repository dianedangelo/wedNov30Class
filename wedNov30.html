		<h1>I Love Those Classic No. 2 Pencils</h1>
		<p>This is coming in a little late for true back-to-school season, which starts right after the 4th of July these days. <br>To be sure, by the weekend before my daughter started the first grade, the aisles and bins were veritably picked clean.</p>

		<p>Of course, you always find a sort of very cheap house brand yellow pencil that is often even cheaper for kids going<br> back to school. I was happy, this year and last year, to see that my daughter’s classmates brought with them to <br>school Ticonderoga pencils, USA Golds, and Yoobi pencils in many colors. Maybe you’re buying for an entire class<br> on a really small budget. Maybe you’re stuck supplying an office with as many pencils for $7 as you can get. We’re<br> here to help with your Very Cheap needs.*</p>

		<img src="images/points.jpg"><p>It was a $1 pack of USA-made pencils in 2004 that got me interested in pencils. Very Cheaps hold a special place<br>in my heart pencilcase. And, hell, I really like the aesthetics of a yellow pencil with a silver ferrule and pink eraser.</p>
		
		<p>Thought I’d lighten the mood a bit, after the last week of…I don’t know. Despite surprising backlash, we received<br> a bevy of encouraging and warm private messages, which are very much appreciated.</p> 

		<p>We never meant to start such a stir, though we stand by our post. It was merely a list of suggestions for how to<br> diversify the Blackwing Volumes line. Being smart and thoughtful folks, I assumed that Blackwing was thinking along<br> these lines anyway. If I really thought they were sexist and/or racist, I would not contribute to the considerable airtime<br> we devoteto them on Erasable. We make suggestions all the time for Volumes. I am confounded that the various lists of<br> suggestions got so many people so upset and provoked such nastiness in/on various channels.</p><img src="images/ends.jpg"></p>
